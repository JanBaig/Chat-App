Functionality to implement:
- User signup/login + avatar
- Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects.
- Add support for nicknames.
- Change text position of the sender and receivers (One right and the other left).
- Add “{user} is typing” functionality.
- Show who’s online.
- Add private messaging + group chats.
- (IMPO) Confirmation before page reload/close and navigate to the login page

Goals:
- (DONE) Understand the tools needed (Socket.io, NodeJS, ReactJS)
- (DONE) Set backend + frontend
- (DONE) Allow for dialouge (any user)
- (DONE) Display usernames 
- (DONE) Message on new user & user disconnect
    - Display username of disconnected user...
- Change text position of sender and receiver (Allow for multiple users)

Errors:
- The broadcast is showing the message to all users instead of excluding the recently connected One
    - Components automatically re-render when state changes which means that a new socket connection is triggered each time
    - (DONE added global socket instance)Possible fix: Allow for socket connection from the LOGIN page. That way a new connection will not form when
      componenets re-render based on activity from the chat feature.


Note:
as soon as new tab/refresh => new socket created.
if the user refreshes during the chat, then all the socket info is lost and 
the user has to be forced to go back to the login page...
You cannot keep the same socket.io or webSocket client connection when the
page is changed or refreshed.
